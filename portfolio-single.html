		var w1 = "This is my very first poster I have ever made.This was during the studio design class which I learned the basics of design starting from formal elements to branding. At the session, we covered history and influences of Bauhaus school and I applied some rules of Bauhaus style. Only used lines and San serif fonts, picked blue among the primary colors and used diagonal lines and floating out alphabets to make rhythm. I have two different variations. This is a fonts advertising poster and I fused it with hourglass. Inside of glass there are alphabets instead of sands to be able to show the whole character. I also chose a quite modern font that I thought it’s interesting to see the combination between very recent font and Bauhaus style.";

		var w2 = "I made this poster for school project. He is Andy Cruz, one of my favorite type designers, co-founder and art director of House Industries. I got fascinated with eclectic, punky and passionate fonts he has designed. I tried to incorporate punk rock-bands low- fidelity poster feeling into this poster. I found his black and white imagery on AIGA page and thought the contrast between his right and left sides of face and slight evil smile could be a great resource that can make something fun. I distorted fonts a bit to replace half of his face. And mimicked smirk with “Z”. Also I played with doodling horn, ear ring and xxx face tattoo. There are two variations with/without text message bubbles.";

		var w3 = "This poster is about Gustavo Dudamel who is conductor of LA Phil. I used swiss grid system on this poster and chose black and white imagery of him to not be distracted by colors. Grey and Pink are one of my go-to color palette, it works well when it needs to emphasize some important information also the same time look professional. I put his name in small pink square boxes and placed them unevenly.";	

		var w4 = "She is one of my co-worker and my best friends. This took only about an hour but she really liked it a lot. The reason why I wanted to include this work in my portfolio is this is the first trigger realizing that I feel fulfilled making people happy and having conversation with my works. I used orange and yellow for background. Those colors remind me her kindness and positive energy. And I think orange and yellow are colors that can represent LA (beautiful sunset, nice sunny weather). We both are Korean but we met in LA and we have made a lot of great memories in here. Therefore those colors are dominant in this illustration. I also wanted to incorporate her smile and hobbies. Beautiful smile with dimples is her signature and she likes to go skateboarding and make codes as hobby.";

		var w5 = "Simple example of my illustrator proficiency.";

		var w6 = "I chose one Wired magazine article on the internet and designed layout for it. I used pink from Baby driver and yellow from Atomic Blonde. Put white background for less confusion and readability. I put some drawings on poster such as gun, flame, lanes and up side down car. They are easy associations of each movie. Also put some pink squares to emphasize the initial letters.";

		var w7 = "I made 4 by 4 little booklet for kids. I used one font family “Agenda” and put short poems about apple, banana, car and dog. Also I played with only CMY colors (cyan, magenta, yellow) and geometric shapes with alphabets. The main focus is giving easy and long lasting impression using repetition and contrast of colors.";

		var w8 = "This is label design for coffee bottle. I found a coffee bottle in local coffee shop that has little handle on the cap helping open the bottle. And I immediately thought about a grenade and can make it more fun with it. So I put the soldier pointing to the handle and named it “final shot”. The shot means coffee shot but also shot that soldier is about to throw. It is a metaphor pop this bottle as grenade and drink it in your battle field. Because we all live in our own battle ground and we work hard. So I hoped this final shot can be stress-blown shot for stressed people. And I made three different variation of marketing material.";

		var w9 = "I designed my own business card and stationary. My name has U and N which have similar shape horizontally so I took advantage from it. Used Arista pro alternate ultralight fonts which has the perfect reflected U and N. I put the grey box below the name and extended line from I through the box. I have decided to not add colors to be looking like more professional because the font is already round and san serif. Also I made card specification document as practice for future and it was really great experience can feel the responsibility of work.";

		var w10 = " I designed and did branding a fish taco truck. It’s called Spicy Mermaid. As the main menu is spicy fish taco, I associated with punky mermaid in naming. On the logo, there is a mermaid tail has flame as metaphor of spiciness. The whole mint blue background for giving hints of food category which is sea food.";	

		var w11 = "Basic simple card style web design with short descriptions and photos of artists";
		var w12 = "Grid style design using percentage adjustment of width";

		var w13 = "My own web site design. Used my portrait and favorite colors.";
